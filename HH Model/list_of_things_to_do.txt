1. 

Poisson random inputs for the following variables: 
  g_AMPA = 0 
  g_GABA_A = 0
  g_NMDA = 0
  g_GABA_B = 0


2. 

Make a function, ext_I(), that applies a positive current to the neuron when there is external electrical stimulation.

def ext_I(t):
  if t < 5:
    i = 0
  elif t>5 && t<7:
    i = 10

  return i

3. Think about effects on NMDA blockage on electrically stimulated signals:
 - Resting membrane potential is hyperpolarised. 
 - Internal calcium changes and effects on pre-synaptic release of neurotransmitters. 

4. Put the two models together.
